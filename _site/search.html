It is calculated by: ROI = (gross revenue - cost)/cost. Of the properties, I was most interested in budget, genres, and vote scores. Specifically, I investigated:  Did high budget movies achieve high ROI?  Did specific genres lead to high ROI?  Did high score movies achieve high ROI?The work process was:  Data overview  Data wrangling  Univariate exploration  Q1: Did high budget movies achieve high ROI?

With online search, I learned that this happens sometimes; e.g., a director makes a ‘mini’ version before the full scale. So I kept all the records.Missing valuesThe ‘genre’ had only 23 nulls, but there were many records with 0 value for the budget and/or revenue. I had to remove all the records that belonged to any of the following:  null for ‘genre’  0 for ‘budget_adj’  0 for ‘revenue_adj’Incorrect valuesAs a minimum effort to ensure correctness of budget and revenue values, I inspected data points at both ends (the lowest and highest).Top budget moviedf[df['budget_adj'] == df['budget_adj'].max()]                  id      budget      revenue      original_title      genres      vote_average      release_year      budget_adj      revenue_adj                  2244      46528      425000000      11087569      The Warrior's Way      Adventure|Fantasy|Action|Western|Thriller      6.4      2010      425000000.0      11087569.0      Although the above says that ‘The Warrior’s Way’ is the highest budget movie by 425 million, online search revealed that the budget of it is 42.5 million. After this correction, the highest budget became $368 millon of ‘Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,’ which is correct.Top revenue movie‘Avartar’ came out as the highest revenue movie, and online search confirmed it.Bottom budget movieI displayed several lowest budget movies, and got puzzled with extremely low values like $1, $50, or ‘$100. I did online search and found that:  ‘Primer (2004)’ is considered as the lowest budget movie (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-budget_film)  Many of the low budget values are wrong; for example, the budget of ‘Lost &amp; Found (1999)’ is $30 million, not $1.3, ‘Joyful Noise (2012)’, $25 millon, not $23, ‘Weekend (2011)’, $0.14 millon, not $7755, etc. With the above findings, I inclined to believe that $8081, budget of ‘Primer (2004)’, should be the lowest. I removed movies whose budget was lower than it.Bottom revenue movieAgain, online search made me distrust data points whose revenue was lower than the revenue of ‘Best Man Down’ ($1840.6). They were removed.Data typedf.loc[:, 'genres'] = df['genres'].str.strip().str.split(\"|\")Values of ‘genres’ transformed from string to list, e.g., Action|Adventure|Science Fiction –&gt; [Action, Adventure, Science Fiction], for convenience in later analysis.OutliersFundamentally, I identified records that might inhibit finding a general direction by looking into each variable, and removed them.BudgetSeveral records on the top stand out, but I considered them still continuous.Number of movies by genresFor each genre, I calculated the number of movies involving it.# Generate a long format dataframe df_long = df.explode('genres')# Count the number of inclusion of each genre.df_long['genres'].value_counts()Drama              1746Comedy             1347Thriller           1197Action             1078Adventure           746Romance             660Crime               649Science Fiction     518Horror              460Family              423Fantasy             393Mystery             344Animation           200Music               134History             129War                 119Western              52Documentary          34Foreign              13TV Movie              1Name: genres, dtype: int64I noted that the bottom four genres are involved by a quite small number of movies, less than 100. The number of Western-involved movies is fewer than the half of War-involved movies. I decided to exclude these genres.Vote scoresJudging that it is so far away from the nearest, I removed the data point with the lowest value.ROIsThe top two data points were considered too far away that I removed them.To sum up, the data wrangling step removed 7138 records leaving 3728 records in total. The largest removal, 7011 records, was due to value missingness.Univariate ExplorationI surveyed the variables, budget, ROI, genres, and vote score, individually, before looking at relationships between them.BudgetThe budget is long right tailed, ranging from $8081 to $368 millon (redline for median).For later analysis, I categorized values into four groups as follows.qt = df['budget_adj'].quantile([0.25, 0.5, 0.75])def binning4(x):    if x &lt; qt[0.25]:        return \"Low\"    elif (x &gt;= qt[0.25]) &amp; (x &lt; qt[0.5]):        return \"Moderate\"    elif (x &gt;= qt[0.5]) &amp; (x &lt; qt[0.75]):        return 'Little High'    elif x &gt;= qt[0.75]:        return 'High'    df['budget_level'] = df['budget_adj'].apply(binning4)ROIThe ROI column is extremely long tailed, ranging from -1 to 699. More than 3500 out of 3728 fall into between -1 and 22.3 as shown below.I categorized the ROI in the same way to the budget.GenresI plotted the percentage of movies involving each genre. It shows that almost the half of movies involved ‘Drama’, and ‘Comedy’ is the next most involved genre by about %35.Vote scoreThe vote score seems normally distributed (mean = 6.2, SD = 0.8).Q1: Did high budget movies achieve high ROI?I plotted a scatter plot (top), ROI distribution by budget level (bottom-left), and median value by budget level (bottom right).It is hard to find a relationship in the scatter plot. But, the boxplot by the budget level shows that ROI values of low budget movies span a wide range, up to 500, the largest ROI value in the dataset. The larger budget groups have the narrower spread of ROIs. As well, the comparison of median values shows that the low and high budget levels have a little higher median values than the moderate and little high budget levels.Meanwhile, I created a contigency table and plotted it as below.It is found that low budget movies achieve the low and high level ROIs more frequently than the moderate and little high level ROIs. As opposed to it, high budget movies obtain the moderate and little high level ROIs more frequenlty.Q2: Did specific genres lead to high ROI?To compare ROIs between the genres, I calculated two types of means:  Simple mean: Simply add up all ROIs and divide it with the total number of movies involving that genre.  Weighted mean: Assign weights based on the number genre types involved in a movie. A ROI is multiplied by 1/number_of_genres and the sum is divided by the sum of 1/number_of_genres values.For example, let’s assume we have a long format dataframe of three movies as below:            id      genre      ROI      number of genres                  1      drama      3      2              1      comedy      3      2              2      comedy      5      1              3      drama      2      1      Simple means are:  drama, (3+2) / 2 = 2.5  comedy, (3+5) / 2 = 4Weighted means are:  drama, (3x1/2+2x1/1) / (1/2+1) = (1.5+2) / 1.5 = 2.33  comedy, (3x1/2+5x1/1) / (1/2+1) = (1.5+5) / 1.5 = 4.33The below shows results of the two methods. The results are not exactly the same (especailly, ‘Horror’ has a larger difference between the two results than other genrens), but  order is the same.The results hints that ‘Horror’ tends to bring quite larger ROIs compared to the others. The next profitable genre is ‘Music’ by round 4 or 5 smaller ROI than Horror. ROI values gradually decrease after ‘Music, and thus the difference between ‘Music’ and ‘History’ is only about 3.5.Although I believe that I obtained an acceptable finding with my approach, it is a shame that effect of combination of genres was not studied. This issue will be discussed a bit more in ‘Limitations’ section at the end.Q3: Did high score movies achieve high ROI?The chart shows that the high ROI level tends to bring a little higher median of vote scores (0.4 higher than the little high level, and 0.7 than the low level).ConclusionsSummaryWith the exploration, I found association between 1) budget size and ROI, 2) genres and ROI, and 3) vote average score and ROI. To sum up:  I found contrary behavior between the low and high budget groups, in terms of their ROIs. Low budget movies are more likely to be big fail or big success, and high budget movies tend to end up in the middle. This behavior seems a consequence. Considering different capabilities in reaching the audience and the definition of ROI, this behavior seems natural.  The genre type that resulted in the highest ROI on average is ‘Horror’, and the smallest ROI, ‘History’,  among 17 genre types (excluding ‘Western’, ‘Documentary’, ‘Foreign’, and ‘TV Movie’).  It was found that the higher ROI level group tend to associate with higher mean of the vote average.Based on these findings, it is considered that production of low budget, horror movies that receive high score from the audience is likely to lead to high ROI.LimitationsThe exploration has several limitations as follows:  Only about a third of the original datapoints were used in the analysis, since the rest had missing or outlying values. As well, there was no further work to check if any pattern exists in missing or outlying values.  In finding association between genres and ROIs, potential effect of genre combination was not explored, and it makes the result somewhat insecure. For instance, let’s assume the following dataset of four movies:            id      genres      ROI                  1      Drama      2              2      Drama, Family      8              3      Drama, Horror      8              4      Family      2      Calculation of weighted means (Drama, 5; Family, 4; Horor, 8) indicates that the highest ROI genre is Horror. However, it is not sure if this is the power of the Horror genre or result of pairing with Drama, since it does not have movies that involve only Horror.",
